👋 Hey there! I’m @devanshi-2000  
👀 I’m super curious about uncovering patterns in data—whether it’s customer behavior, crime trends, or anything in between.  
🌱 Right now, I’m diving into Snowflake, Airflow, and leveling up my SQL game.  
💞️ Would love to collaborate on fun data projects—especially anything with storytelling, dashboards, or solving real-world problems.  
📫 Reach me on linkedin.com/in/sharmadevanshi2000 or drop a message at devanshsharma0803@gmail.com 
😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
⚡ Fun fact: I don’t just analyze data—I treat it like a puzzle or a painting. I actually enjoy making dashboards look beautiful and meaningful!
